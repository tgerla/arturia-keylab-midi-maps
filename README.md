# arturia-keylab-presets

These are my MIDI controller maps for my Arturia Keylab mkII. There's only one so far, for a Roland MV-1.

Bank 1: Sound design mode: the sliders and knobs adjust the sound design parameters.
Bank 2: Mixing mode: sliders adjust track volume and knobs adjust pan.
Bank 3: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: MFX parameters

To use this open the Arturia MIDI Control Center and import it as a template.
